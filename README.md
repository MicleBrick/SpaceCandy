Star Legacy optional client side Forge mod with enhanced visual effects and performance optimizations! 
To get it, first you'll need Forge (https://files.minecraftforge.net/). 
After setting up Forge, add the "SpaceCandy.jar" file to your mods folder. 
We also recommend that you get optifine from optifine.net and put that in your mods folder too
